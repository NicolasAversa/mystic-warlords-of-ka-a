# History

Mystic Warlords of Ka’a is a two-player collectible card game based on the fictional game of the same name from the television show The Big Bang Theory. It was originally introduced as a “freemium” game on Facebook, produced by Warner Brothers and Dire Wolf Digital. It went into Beta testing around September 2011. The game went into full release in December 2011 / January 2012. On June 18, 2012 Dire Wolf Digital announced on the Mystic Warlords of Ka'a Facebook page that the game would be shutting down on June 29, 2012 and would be deleted from Facebook. No reason was given for the shut-down, although it has been speculated that the game was not making enough of a profit to suit Warner Brothers and/or Dire Wolf, and as such development was ended. Dire Wolf Digital has since removed any mention of the game from their web page.

The game was intended to be a typical freemium Facebook game, whereby players could earn better cards for their decks via playing the game to earn "Newton Points" (the premium in-game currency) or they could pay actual money to Facebook to buy Facebook Points, which could then be converted to Newton Points. These Newton Points could then be spent on cards and other in-game upgrades, such as themed squads, promo cards, extra missions, or semi-useless decorations for their home area.

Game play consisted of a one-on-one card battle that was split into two parts. The first part, the Duel, was trump-based game play, where one player could best the other by playing cards of a higher value. Play alternated between the two opponents until one could no longer trump the other, with the loser taking damage to their "life points" equal to the number of cards remaining in their hand. Once the duel was complete the cards that were played in the duel were used in a secondary, more complex battle phase. The first player to be reduced to zero life points (or lower) during either phase of the game lost the game.

The game originally featured four factions (Wind Riders, Tempest Masters, Sun Lords, and Foxlings), with a fifth (Twilight Elves) added in the unfinished Shadow Lords expansion.

Alternate artwork was produced for three different cards: Jewel of Osiris, Potion of Zancor, and Three-Headed Lion. This alternate artwork was made available by the use of non-exclusive codes that could be entered into the game's store.

Jewel of Osiris - code word: shinytrinket

Potion of Zancor - code word: ozmazing

Three-Headed Lion - code word: MOONPIE

Other than the alternate artwork, the cards were functionally the same. A fourth promotional card was supposed to be made available with the Big Bang Theory Party Game, but that was apparently scrapped as the Facebook game was closed before the Party Game went into wide release.

Cards were broken down into five different levels or rarity: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, and Promo. The first four are the to-be-expected levels of availability in a collectible card game, with the power levels of the cards following suit with the Rarity level. The last level of cards, Promo, was reserved for cards that were not available in the "booster packs" that the players could buy in-game. These cards were either earned by crafting them in-game, being shared by other players as a random freebie in boosters that they purchased, or via promotional codes and giveaways. Other cards that were generally not available to the players through booster packs were given the Promo ranking as well. These included temporary cards that could be activated in-game, or cards that were never available to the players as they were intended for use only by the "boss" characters in the game. These cards are extremely overpowered and heavily destabilize game play, but are included for the sake of completeness.

The majority of the cards available in the game came in two versions; a standard version that would typically be found in the booster packs that were sold to the players, and a Gold variant of the same card, which typically had an improved rank rating. The Gold variants were considered rarer than the standard versions of the cards. Some standard cards did not have Gold variants, and all the Promo-level cards that were available via in-game crafting or as temporary cards are lacking Gold variants.
